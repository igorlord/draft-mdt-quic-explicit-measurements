# Introduction

Packet loss is a hard and pervasive problem of day-to-day network operation.
Proactively detecting, measuring, and locating it is crucial to maintaining high
QoS and timely resolution of crippling end-to-end throughput issues. To this
effect, in a TCP-dominated world, network operators have been heavily relying on
information present in the clear in TCP headers: sequence and acknowledgment
numbers, and SACKs when enabled. These allow for quantitative estimation of
packet loss by passive on-path observation.

With QUIC, the equivalent transport headers are encrypted, and passive packet
loss observation is not possible, as described in {{!RFC9065}}.

Measuring TCP loss between similar endpoints cannot be relied upon to
evaluate QUIC loss. QUIC could be routed by the network differently and
the fraction of Internet traffic delivered using QUIC is increasing every
year. It is imperative to measure packet loss experienced by QUIC users
directly.

The Alternate-Marking method {{AltMark}} defines a consolidated method to
perform packet loss, delay, and jitter measurements on live traffic. However,
as noted in {{EXPLICIT-MEASUREMENTS}}, applying {{AltMark}} to end-to-end
transport-layer connections is not easy because packet identification and
marking by network nodes is prevented when QUIC encrypted transport-layer header
is being used.

This document defines the Explicit Flow Measurement Protocol (EFMP) which is
used by QUIC endpoints to enable packet loss measurements using Explicit
Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques defined in {{EXPLICIT-MEASUREMENTS}}.

Measurement bits are sent in dedicated EFMP packets that are coalesced with other
QUIC packets in UDP datagrams.

## Notational Conventions    {#conventions}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

# On-Path RTT Observation

{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} already introduces an explicit per-flow transport-layer signal
for hybrid measurement of RTT. This signal consists of a Spin bit that toggles
once per RTT.

# On-Path Loss Observation

There are three sources of loss that network operators need to observe
to guarantee high QoS:

* _upstream loss_ - loss between the sender and the observation point
  ({{upstreamloss}})

* _downstream loss_ - loss between the observation point and the destination
  ({{downstreamloss}})

* _observer loss_ - loss by the observer itself that does not cause downstream
  loss ({{observerloss}})

The upstream and downstream loss together constitute _end-to-end loss_
({{endtoendloss}}).

## On-Path Loss Signaling Protocol

{{EXPLICIT-MEASUREMENTS}} introduces several techniques for using explicit loss
bits in the clear portion of transport protocol headers to signal packet loss to
on-path network devices. The explicit loss bits used in this document are the
"sQuare signal" bit (Q) and the "Loss event" bit (L) (see {{squarebit}} and
{{lossbit}}). This approach follows the recommendations of {{!RFC8558}} that
recommends explicit path signals.

This document defines the Explicit Flow Measurement Protocol (EFMP) that takes
inspiration from {{TRAIN}} that uses QUIC Long Header packets that are prepended
to QUIC v1 or v2 packets as carriers of path signals.

While the exploitation of only Q can help in measuring the _upstream loss_ and
only L can help in measuring the _end-to-end loss_, both are required to detect
and measure the other types of losses (_downstream loss_ and _observer loss_).

## Recommended Use of the Signals

The loss signal is not designed for use in automated control of the network in
environments where loss bits are set by untrusted hosts. Instead, the signal is
to be used for troubleshooting individual flows and for monitoring the network
by aggregating information from multiple flows and raising operator alarms if
aggregate statistics indicate a potential problem.


# Loss Bits

The draft introduces two bits that are to be present in EFMP packets.

* Q: The "sQuare signal" bit is toggled every N outgoing packets, as explained
  below in {{squarebit}}.

* L: The "Loss event" bit is set to 0 or 1 according to the Unreported Loss
  counter, as explained below in {{lossbit}}.

Each endpoint maintains appropriate counters independently and separately for
each connection 4-tuple and Destination Connection ID. Whenever this
specification refers to connections, it is referring to packets sharing the same
4-tuple and Destination Connection ID. A "QUIC connection", however, refers to
connections in the traditional QUIC sense.

## Setting the sQuare Signal Bit on Outgoing Packets {#squarebit}

The sQuare bit (Q bit) takes its name from the square wave generated by its
signal. This method is based on the Alternate-Marking method {{AltMark}}.
The sQuare Value is initialized to the Initial Q Value (0 or 1) and is reflected
in the Q bit of every outgoing packet. The sQuare value is inverted after
sending every N packets (a Q run). Hence, Q Period is 2*N. The Q bit represents
"packet color" as defined by {{?RFC8321}}.

Observation points can estimate upstream losses by counting the number of
packets during one period of the square signal, as described in {{usage}}.

### Q Run Length Selection

The sender is expected to choose N (Q run length) based on the expected amount
of loss and reordering on the path. The choice of N strikes a compromise -- the
observation could become too unreliable in case of packet reordering and/or
severe loss if N is too small, while short connections may not yield a useful
upstream loss measurement if N is too large (see {{upstreamloss}}).

The value of N MUST be at least 64 and be a power of 2. This requirement allows
an Observer to infer the Q run length by observing one period of the square
signal. It also allows the Observer to identify flows that set the loss bits to
arbitrary values (see {{ossification}}).

If the sender does not have sufficient information to make an informed decision
about Q run length, the sender SHOULD use N=64, since this value has been
extensively tested in large-scale field tests and yielded good results.
Alternatively, the sender MAY also choose a random N for each connection,
increasing the chances of using a Q run length that gives the best signal for
some connections.

The sender MUST keep the value of N constant for a given connection. The sender
can change the value of N during a QUIC connection by switching to a new
Destination Connection ID, if one is available.


## Setting the Loss Event Bit on Outgoing Packets {#lossbit}

The Loss Event bit uses the Unreported Loss counter maintained by the QUIC
protocol. The Unreported Loss counter is initialized to 0, and the L bit of
every outgoing packet indicates whether the Unreported Loss counter is positive
(L=1 if the counter is positive, and L=0 otherwise). The value of the
Unreported Loss counter is decremented every time a packet with L=1 is sent.

The value of the Unreported Loss counter is incremented for every packet that
the protocol declares lost, using QUIC's existing loss detection machinery. If
the implementation is able to rescind the loss determination later, a positive
Unreported Loss counter MAY be decremented due to the rescission, but it SHOULD
NOT become negative.

This loss signaling is similar to loss signaling in {{?RFC7713}}, except the
Loss Event bit is reporting the exact number of lost packets, whereas the Echo
Loss bit in {{?RFC7713}} is reporting an approximate number of lost bytes.

Observation points can estimate the end-to-end loss, as determined by the
upstream endpoint, by counting packets in this direction with the L bit equal
to 1, as described in {{usage}}.


# Using Loss Bits for Passive Loss Measurement {#usage}


## End-To-End Loss    {#endtoendloss}

The Loss Event bit allows an observer to calculate the end-to-end loss rate by
counting packets with the L bit value of 0 and 1 for a given connection. The
end-to-end loss rate is the fraction of packets with L=1.

The assumption here is that upstream loss affects packets with L=0 and L=1
equally. If some loss is caused by tail-drop in a network device, this may
be a simplification. If the sender congestion controller reduces the
packet send rate after loss, there may be a sufficient delay before sending
packets with L=1 that they have a greater chance of arriving at the observer.


## Upstream Loss   {#upstreamloss}

Blocks of N (Q run length) consecutive packets are sent with the same value of
the Q bit, followed by another block of N packets with an inverted value of the
Q bit. Hence, knowing the value of N, an on-path observer can estimate the
amount of loss after observing at least N packets. The upstream loss rate (`u`)
is one minus the average number of packets in a block of packets with the same Q
value (`p`) divided by N (`u=1-avg(p)/N`).

The observer needs to be able to tolerate packet reordering that can blur the
edges of the square signal.

The observer needs to differentiate packets as belonging to different
connections, since they use independent counters.


## Correlating End-to-End and Upstream Loss    {#losscorrelation}

Upstream loss is calculated by observing packets that did not suffer the
upstream loss. End-to-end loss, however, is calculated by observing subsequent
packets after the sender's protocol detected the loss. Hence, end-to-end loss
is generally observed with a delay of between 1 RTT (loss declared due to
multiple duplicate acknowledgments) and 1 RTO (loss declared due to a timeout)
relative to the upstream loss.

The connection RTT can sometimes be estimated by timing protocol handshake
messages. This RTT estimate can be greatly improved by observing a dedicated
protocol mechanism for conveying RTT information, such as the latency Spin bit
of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

Whenever the observer needs to perform a computation that uses both upstream and
end-to-end loss rate measurements, it SHOULD use upstream loss rate leading the
end-to-end loss rate by approximately 1 RTT. If the observer is unable to
estimate RTT of the connection, it should accumulate loss measurements over time
periods of at least 4 times the typical RTT for the observed connections.

If the calculated upstream loss rate exceeds the end-to-end loss rate calculated
in {{endtoendloss}}, then either the Q run length is too short for the amount of
packet reordering or there is observer loss, described in {{observerloss}}. If
this happens, the observer SHOULD adjust the calculated upstream loss rate to
match end-to-end loss rate.


## Downstream Loss   {#downstreamloss}

Because downstream loss affects only those packets that did not suffer upstream
loss, the end-to-end loss rate (`e`) relates to the upstream loss rate (`u`) and
downstream loss rate (`d`) as `(1-u)(1-d)=1-e`. Hence, `d=(e-u)/(1-u)`.


## Observer Loss   {#observerloss}

A typical deployment of a passive observation system includes a network tap
device that mirrors network packets of interest to a device that performs
analysis and measurement on the mirrored packets. The observer loss is the loss
that occurs on the mirror path.

Observer loss affects upstream loss rate measurement, since it causes the
observer to account for fewer packets in a block of identical Q bit values (see
{{upstreamloss}}). The end-to-end loss rate measurement, however, is unaffected
by the observer loss, since it is a measurement of the fraction of packets with
the set L bit value, and the observer loss would affect all packets equally (see
{{endtoendloss}}).

The need to adjust the upstream loss rate down to match end-to-end loss rate as
described in {{losscorrelation}} is a strong indication of the observer loss,
whose magnitude is between the amount of such adjustment and the entirety of the
upstream loss measured in {{upstreamloss}}. Alternatively, a high apparent
upstream loss rate could be an indication of significant reordering, possibly
due to packets belonging to a single connection being multiplexed over several
upstream paths with different latency characteristics.


# Implementation

## EFMP Packet
An EFMP packet is a QUIC long header packet that follows the QUIC invariants;
see {{Section 5.1 of INVARIANTS}}.

{{fig-EFMP-packet}} shows the format of the EFMP packet using the conventions
from {{Section 4 of INVARIANTS}}.

~~~ artwork
EFMP Packet {
  Header Form (1) = 1,
  Reserved (1),
  Q Bit (1),
  L Bit (1),
  Spin Bit (1),
  Reserved (3),
  Version (32) = 0xTBD,
  Destination Connection ID Length (8),
  Destination Connection ID (0..2040),
  Source Connection ID Length (8),
  Source Connection ID (0..2040),
}
~~~
{: #fig-EFMP-packet title="EFMP Packet Format"}

The most significant bit (0x80) of the packet indicates that this is a QUIC long
header packet.  The next bit (0x40) is reserved and can be set according to
{{!QUIC-BIT=RFC9287}}.

The six least significant bits of the first octet of an EFMP packet forms the
EFMP payload:

sQuare Signal Bit (Q):

: The first bit of the EFMP payload (0x20) is is the sQuare signal
bit, set as described in {{squarebit}}.

Loss Event Bit (L):

: The second bit (0x10) is the Loss event bit, set as described in {{lossbit}}.

Latency Spin Bit (S):

: The third bit (0x8) is the latency spin bit. This bit is set to the value
of the spin bit in the QUIC Short Header packet that follows directly after the
EFMP packet in the same UDP datagram.

The three least significant bits (0x7) are reserved for future use.

An EFMP packet includes a Destination Connection ID field that is set to the same
value as other packets in the same datagram; see
{{Section 12.2 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

The Source Connection ID field is set to match the Source Connection ID field of
any packet that follows. If the next packet in the datagram has a short header
({{Section 5.2 of INVARIANTS}}), the Source Connection ID field is empty.

EFMP packets are always coalesced with other QUIC packets and SHOULD be included
as the first packet in a UDP datagram.

## Transport Parameter  {#tp}

A QUIC endpoint indicates that it is willing to receive EFMP packets by including
the transport parameter:

efmp_supported (0xTBD):

: efmp_supported transport parameter is an integer value, encoded as a
variable-length integer, that can be set to 0 or 1, indicating the level of
EFMP support. The value of 0 indicates that the endpoint is able to receive
EFMP packets but will not be sending any, while the value of 1 indicates
that the endpoint is also willing to send EFMP packets.

A client MUST NOT use remembered value of efmp_supported for 0-RTT connections.

Except for the cases outlined in {{ossification}}, it is RECOMMENDED for the
server to consistently include the efmp_supported parameter. This enables
clients to utilize loss bits at their discretion.

## EFMP Packet Processing
An EFMP packet is identified by the header form bit (0x80) of the first byte of
a UDP datagram payload and the 32-bit version field with the value (0xTBD) that
directly follows the first octet. Since the EFMP payload is part of the first
octet, an observer does not need to process a packet beyond the version field.

# Ossification Considerations  {#ossification}

Accurate loss reporting is not critical for the operation of the QUIC protocol,
though its presence in a sufficient number of connections is important
for the operation of networks.

The use of EFMP is amenable to "greasing" described in {{!RFC8701}} and MUST be
greased. The greasing should be accomplished similarly to the latency Spin bit
greasing in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Namely, implementations MUST NOT include
efmp_supported transport parameter for a random selection of at least one in
every 16 QUIC connections.

It is possible to observe packet reordering near the edge of the square signal.
A middle box might observe the signal and try to fix packet reordering that it
can identify, though only a small fraction of reordering can be fixed using this
method. The Latency Spin bit signal edge can be used for the same purpose.


# Security Considerations

The measurements described in this document do not involve new packets injected
into the network causing potential harm to the network itself and to data
traffic. The measurements could be harmed by a malicious endpoint misreporting
losses or an attacker injecting artificial traffic. In the environments where
such attacks are possible and cannot be identified by on-path observers, loss
signal should not be used for automated control of the network.

In the absence of packet loss, the Q bit signal does not provide any information
that cannot be observed by simply counting packets transiting a network
path. The L bit signal discloses internal state of the protocol's loss detection
machinery, but this state can often be gleaned by timing packets and observing
congestion controller response. Hence, loss bits do not provide a viable new
mechanism to attack QUIC data integrity and secrecy.

## Optimistic ACK Attack

A defense against an Optimistic ACK Attack {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} involves a
sender randomly skipping packet numbers to detect a receiver acknowledging
packet numbers that have never been received. The Q bit signal may inform the
attacker which packet numbers were skipped on purpose and which had
been actually lost (and are, therefore, safe for the attacker to
acknowledge). To use the Q bit for this purpose, the attacker must first
receive at least an entire Q run of packets, which renders the attack
ineffective against a delay-sensitive congestion controller.

For QUIC v1 connections, if the attacker can make its peer transmit data using a
single large stream, examining offsets in STREAM frames can reveal whether
packet number skips are deliberate. In that case, the Q bit signal provides no
new information (but it does save the attacker the need to remove packet
protection). However, an endpoint that communicates using {{DATAGRAM}} and uses
a loss-based congestion controller MAY shorten the current Q run by the number
of skipped packets. For example, skipping a single packet number will invert the
sQuare signal one outgoing packet sooner.


# Privacy Considerations

To minimize unintentional exposure of information, loss bits provide an explicit
loss signal -- a preferred way to share information per {{!RFC8558}}.

{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} allows changing connection IDs in the middle of a QUIC
connection to reduce the likelihood of a passive observer linking old and new
subflows to the same device. Hence, a QUIC implementation would need to reset
all counters when it changes connection ID used for outgoing packets. It would
also need to avoid incrementing Unreported Loss counter for loss of packets sent
with a different connection ID.

Accurate loss information allows identification and correlation of network
conditions upstream and downstream of the observer. This could be a powerful
tool to identify connections that attempt to hide their origin networks, if the
adversary is able to affect network conditions in those origin networks.
Similar information can be obtained by packet timing and inferring congestion
controller response to network events, but loss information provides a clearer
signal.

Implementations MUST allow administrators of clients and servers to disable loss
reporting either globally or per QUIC connection. Additionally, as described in
{{ossification}}, loss reporting MUST be disabled for a certain fraction of all
QUIC connections.


# IANA Considerations

This document registers a new value in the QUIC Transport Parameter Registry:

Value: 0xTBD (if this document is approved)

Parameter Name: efmp_supported

Specification: Indicates that the endpoint supports the explicit flow measurement
protocol.
   An endpoint that advertises this transport parameter can EFMP packets.
   An endpoint that advertises this transport parameter with value 1 can also
   send EFMP packets.
